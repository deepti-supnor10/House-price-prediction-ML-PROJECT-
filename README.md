# House-price-prediction-ML-PROJECT-
The "House Price Prediction" project focuses on predicting housing prices using machine learning techniques. By leveraging popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn (sklearn), Matplotlib, Seaborn, this project provides an end-to-end solution for accurate price estimation.

#Project Overview 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The "House Price Prediction" project aims to develop a model that can accurately predict housing prices based on various features. This prediction task is of great significance in real estate and finance, enabling informed decision-making for buyers, sellers, and investors. By employing machine learning algorithms and a curated dataset, this project provides a powerful tool for estimating house prices.

#Key Features
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Data Collection and Processing: The project utilizes the "Bangalore house " dataset, which can be directly downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset contains features such as location, sqft, bath, and bhk. Using Pandas, the data is processed and transformed to ensure it is suitable for analysis.

Data Visualization: The project employs data visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset. Matplotlib and Seaborn are utilized to create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots. These visualizations provide a deeper understanding of the relationships between features and help identify trends and patterns.

Train-Test Split: To evaluate the performance of the regression model, the project employs the train-test split technique. The dataset is split into training and testing subsets, ensuring that the model is trained on a portion of the data and evaluated on unseen data. This allows for an accurate assessment of the model's predictive capabilities.

Regression Model using linear Regression: The project utilizes the Linear Regression algorithm. 

#Conclusion
